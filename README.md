# closepass
Framework for building a close pass sensing device using off the shelf components and open source software.
----

Cyclists often get 'close passed' by other vehicles, compromising their safety. Advised close pass distance in the UK is 1.5m. The purpose of the device is to record close passes and their GPS coordinates, so that this data can be collated and safety hotspots identified. This data can be useful for safety campaigners or local councils conducting surveys.

The device can be put togther using off the shelf components.
